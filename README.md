Fake News Detection

This is a data mining project to explore and understand the senmantics of fake news. In the current climate, a lot of people are exposed to fake news on a daily basis. People's judgment has been clouded and choose to stick with the fake news instead of questioning the source. Fake news can cause more harm than good.

Given a text, we want to determine whther or not it is fake news, is it a reliable source of information for readers.
